# Assignment For Class
## My Partner Was A Stuffed Owl

@joeparislbcc Has assigned an assignment for the entire class where we *interview* class members.
My partner was ``@``AStuffedOwl because there was an uneven number of students in the class.
There was a list of questions for the partners to ask each other.
  1. What are some hobbies?
  2. What is one thing only they can do?
  3. What are 3 things we have in common?
  4. What is a favorite book/movie/song/hobby?
  5. What is the best thing in their life?
  6. What movie scene gives them goosebumps?
  7. What is one thing they could do a 20 minute presentation on with out any preparation?
  8. What is one thing that takes time but in their opinion is worth it?
  9. What is an amazing fact they know?
  10. What was their best pair of shoe?
  11. What is their favorite food combo?
  12. How did they get one of their scars?
  
To all of these questions the answer is still that I was *interviewing* a **Stuffed Owl**.
Here is a picture of the said Owl ![owl](https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_66f5b1f7-bbf8-4a54-89fa-f5d977310747?wid=488&hei=488&fmt=pjpeg)
